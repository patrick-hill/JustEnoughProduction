# JustEnoughProduction
Offline Minecraft Recipe Visualizer 

# Description
JustEnoughProduction is a project to provide modded minecraft players an offline recipe visualizer. It's main goal is to help display many recipes simultaneously as well as provide a handful of useful features to help with coming up complex chains of recipes. 

Currently all items and their respective input and output recipes are loaded in as a JSON file, created by the program RecEx which is used to export recipes from the game during runtime. I will not be providing these JSON recipe files, however for those in the GTNH discord the 2.1.0.0 recipe JSON currently is pinned in #mod-dev.

# Usage & Downloads
Thankfully Python is relitivly intuitive thus, running windowManager.py with IDLE or hopefully any Python interpreter that supports python3 should work for now. 

# Contributions
Please contribute! This project is still very new and I would love the help.
